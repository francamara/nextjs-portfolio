        <p className='text-gray-400 mt-4'>
          I have a huge passion for technology and learning new things every
          day. As a perfectionist, I want to code using the best practices and
          the latest technologies available. Mostly self-taught, I learned to
          code many things and entered a course to see how the programming world
          works and get more into it.
